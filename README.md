**EPheClass** is a curated pipeline for phenotype classification based on a count table of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. We selected a wide range of popular machine learning algorithms, from classic to newer and more complex: k-nearest neighbours (kNN), RF, SVM, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and MLP, and used them to build dynamic ensemble models.

Here are the four periodontitis and gingivitis subsets used for the evaluation of EPheClass.
